# Foolad-Sang-Automation

My initial goal is to automate Foolad Sang Laboratory's daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly reports through learning Python.

## packages

I separate each task into individual files to make them easier to manage.

### daily_reader.py

This package allows me to extract clean data from the FSM laboratory's daily IS report, including:

1. Averages of CO2, granulation data, tonnage, and the number of trucks.
2. Individual analysis values, along with their corresponding times and dates
